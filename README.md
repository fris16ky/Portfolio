# Welcome!

This is my Portfolio project, designed to aid my resume when applying to jobs.

# Validation
Every page of this Portfolio has ran through and corrected as per suggestions from https://validator.w3.org/nu/. 

# Disclaimer
Currently, this website has NOT been adjusted for Mobile viewers, so the styling is pretty horrid. I apologize, I'm currently working through my last semester of College, so I am not sure when I'll take the time to fix the mistakes. Thanks for your understanding. 

# Inspiration

I give a lot of the credit to my ideas to both http://www.ericwadkins.com/ and http://www.meganlandau.com/portfolio-1, just being able to look at their excellent designs was very helpful.

# Information

As for this portfolio, it is a little simplistic, but it gets everything done. There's an introduction to myself, information about the courses I've taken, what languages I know and how in depth, and a place to highlight and learn more about each of the projects I've worked on. I also tried to document the process as best I can, as keeping track of code is very important.
