# Welcome!
This is my Portfolio project, designed to aid my resume when applying to jobs. 
# Inspiration
I give a lot of the credit to my ideas to both http://www.ericwadkins.com/ and http://www.meganlandau.com/portfolio-1, just being able to look at their excellent designs was very helpful. 
# Information
As for this portfolio, it is a little simplistic, but it gets everything done. There's an introduction to myself, information about the courses I've taken, what languages I know and how in depth, and a place to highlight and learn more about each of the projects I've worked on.
