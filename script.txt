This will be a file containing the talking points I want to/should do for each Project Demo: 

Poodle Scheduler (HTML): 
Walk-through of every page
Look into the VS Project code (show how many files for CSS, JS, HTML, where I keep my images and such). 
Slight walkthrough of the Flowchart diagram
Talk about my future scope and what I initially envisioned? Instead of going through my entire Project Report, 
which is already on the Project Page. Make this fluid if including it
Give an example of Adding and Removing a reminder, maybe doing Delete All instead, since I showcase
Delete One in the Description

***Go through one JS file for months to show how I keep track of the most recent reminders + other stuff.
