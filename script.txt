This will be a file containing the talking points I want to/should do for each Project Demo: 

Poodle Scheduler (HTML): 
Walk-through of every page
Look into the VS Project code (show how many files for CSS, JS, HTML, where I keep my images and such). 
Slight walkthrough of the Flowchart diagram
Talk about my future scope and what I initially envisioned? Instead of going through my entire Project Report, 
which is already on the Project Page. Make this fluid if including it
Give an example of Adding and Removing a reminder, maybe doing Delete All instead, since I showcase
Delete One in the Description

To-Do List (React): 
Showcase VS project code
Yarn web to start it up, then have it also load into a waiting Android Studio
Showcase App (adding, checking, removing, image that pops up when all are removed)
^Also for mobile app, alert box when you try to input nothing
Talk about design choices (why this, probably not talk about Tesla tho)
Walk thru Flowchart
Maybe talk about future scope
