These are my notes taken during my 4660 class about my Portfolio and adjusting it to smaller screens/
generally fixing the default styling

Check my suit, make sure everything fits for job fairs/interviews

So, when website is in halfscreen, everything is still fucked up
For this, need to make the project images WAY smaller, will help a ton
Need to move AboutMe pic and everything over too

Width of 1400 is where problems start, learn more runs into text
and about me gets fucked up

1200 width seems to be half-screen for me
Learn More buttons need to change - should be under the text, not to the right
Also most project texts are too low

For matlab skill text, change margins I think? maybe that's why text is spilling over
For each Project page, test out margin-left and right auto?
Only for really small screens

Footer for project pages is smushed; need to adjust the padding between each
hmm I did manual margins. Maybe I can get away with .footerContainer { margin: auto }

 style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 50px" first
 style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 80px" 2nd
 style="margin-right: 60px; margin-top: 3px"
 style="margin-top: 3px"
 style="float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 50px"
 style="float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px"

Now About Me and Resume are on top of each other somehow. Maybe due to margin-top and bottom?

For courses page: need to move image to the left and make it smaller, but that's proving VERY hard
Otherwise, everything is gucci enough
I guess I could make everything relative, and shift the text under the image, and then move the 
classes over. look this shizz up
