These are my notes taken during my 4660 class about my Portfolio and adjusting it to smaller screens/
generally fixing the default styling

Check my suit, make sure everything fits for job fairs/interviews

Width of 1400 is where problems start, learn more runs into text
and about me gets fucked up

For courses page: need to move image to the left and make it smaller, but that's proving VERY hard
Otherwise, everything is gucci enough
I guess I could make everything relative, and shift the text under the image, and then move the 
classes over. look this shizz up

Recent Portfolio notes: 
When mobile screen is detected, change initial scale of meta (very top) to 0.25
Simon also said to make my name bigger (header and the About Me)
Maybe make margins auto for Csharp
^^Figure out a Project pic too for the main page
