      <p class="intro">
        The scope of this project was to create a functioning, accessible
        website for any topic of our choosing. Personally, I have a deep

        I chose to go with nostalgia; Agendas.

      <p class="intro">

        details in a personal Agenda. Thus sprung the idea to modernize it into
        a website, with some playful additions.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        The project was more challenging than initially expected, so I conceded
        to simplify my website to only contain three months; the duration of my
        Project while in class.
