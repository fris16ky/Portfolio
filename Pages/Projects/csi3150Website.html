      <h1>Poodle Scheduler</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        The scope of this project was to create a functioning, accessible
        website for any topic of our choosing. Personally, I have a deep
        affinity for both dogs and the Google system. I have had a Google Pixel
        (2XL and 6) for the last 5 years, and have used the Set a Reminder
        feature every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of creating a mimic or knock-off, I chose to go with nostalgia;
        Agendas. I'm not sure if it was just me, but back in Elementary and
        Middle School I would always write down my day-to-day details in a
        personal Agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, I sprung the idea to modernize a physical agenda into a website,
        whilst implementing a lighter tone with a Puppy Slideshow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project was more challenging than initially expected, so I conceded
        to simplify my website to only contain three months; the duration of my
        Project while in class.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My website, formally known as Poodle Scheduler, was created for the
        midterm of my CSI 3150 - Web and Mobile Systems class. In this class, we
        were tasked with creating a website using the generic combination of
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was my first attempt at venturing into
        the world of web design!
      </p>
      <p>
        My inspiration directly came from Google Calendar. I have had a Google
        phone for over 6 years (Google Pixel 2 XL, then recently the Google
        Pixel 6), and have loved the feature of setting reminders and having
        those sync to the Google Calendar. I have used this feature everyday,
        and it has helped tremendously
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, I strove to create a similar product. With Poodle Scheduler, I
        wanted to bring back the Agendas that I used to use for Elementary and
        Middle School. In this sense, I allowed the user to create and delete
        reminders during the scope of the project; which happened to be until
        the end of 2022. *More info*

      <p>
        To fit the name, I embarked on creating a Puppy Slideshow to showcase my
        other passion; photography and animals. I included simplistic and funny
        pictures of my dog, Mia, along with my friend and Grandparent's dog. In
        the midst, I also added a few photos I took myself of nature. This
        lightened the seriousness of the project, and was a lot of fun to make.
