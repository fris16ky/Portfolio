      <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        This is the first GitHub Pages hosted website that I made whilst in my
        Web and Mobile Systems class in the Fall of 2022. <br />We were tasked
        with designing a dynamic website that includes some sort of user
        interaction,<br />
        accompanied with a
        <a href="../../Media/Files/Project 1 Write-up Logan Howard.pdf"
          >project report</a
        >
        including a flow diagram and estimation of effort.
      </p>

      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        As a background, I have had two Google Pixel phones (2XL and 6), and
        love the Google Calendar features of setting and viewing reminders. Thus
        came the idea of creating my own spin on a reminder-setting and
        calendar-based website application.
      </p>
      <!-- Maybe talk more about how it's a website to be specific? Or maybe it's enough, unsure -->
      <p>
        With this project starting in the fall, I limited the scope of the app
        to the remaining months of the year; October, November, and December.
        Within each month, you can navigate between months, navigate to other
        non-month pages, create a reminder, or delete reminders.
      </p>
      <p>
        To add my own twist, I incorporated my beloved childhood dog, Mia, into
        my website. I created a 'Puppy Slideshow' to showcase my dog, my
        friend's dog, and a few landscape pictures I've taken. Additionally, I
        named the website after her, plus the webicon.

        Mess with/fix styling. I want this to be readable, so don't have the
        text span the entire page. I should probably utilize margins instead of
        sporadic break tags. Also, consider running all of my text through
        Grammarly just to be safe.
