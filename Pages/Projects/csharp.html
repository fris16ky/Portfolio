        <p>
          This was our first lab from EGR 1400, where we created a simple
          picture and button. When clicked, the button would display the rough
          directions that we would need to take to visit Oakland University's
          Engineering Center.

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          In this project, we created two Group Boxes, each with 5 labels and 5
          text boxes. We then created several buttons with different
          functionalities; one to fill the 10 text boxes with random integers
          between 50-100 and 30-100, one to calculate the mean and standard
          deviation of those numbers, one to clear all of the test scores, and
          one to exit out of the app.

          on the gender of the participant and whether they are above or below
          30 years old. The UI provides radio buttons for both gender and age,
          which will change the display criteria depending on which is selected.
          For example, if 'Male' is selected, the user must input their waist,
          hips, forearm, and wrist measurements. Conversely, if 'Female' is
          selected, the user must input their hips, thigh, calf, and wrist
          measurements.

          pounds of lean body weight and fat the user has, along with the
          percentage. The app then gives a suggestion about what their maximum
          weight and body fat percentage should be.

        <h2>Craps Card Game</h2>
        <p>Demo Here!</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          This project involved us re-creating the popular card game
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps">Craps</a>. For this, we
          were given the basic rules, along with a flowchart and a background
          image for our GUI.

        <!-- Talk about this in the demo: This app utilizes form-level variables to transition between two
          states; whether it's the first roll or if the player is rolling again.

        <p class="multi">
          The game keeps track of the user's total score, along with the current
          Point, which is displayed using pucks at the top. Each time the die
          are rolled, two random numbers are generated, along with their
          corresponding dice images. If the roll is not a hit, the Point is
          calculated and maintained, and the game only ends when the user exits
          out.

          controlled by the track bar. By default, the resistor values are

          Voltage starting at 4 Volts. -->
        <p>
          This application has multiple faces, with the base including a track
          bar, three resistors, source voltage, and a Calculate Button. Once
          calculate is clicked, the circuit will now display the voltage running
          through each resistor, along with the overall current in the top left.
        </p>
        <p class="multi">
          If the track bar is still on screen, the user can click a check box to
          remove the middle resistor from the circuit. The calculations are
          roughly the same; the user can input values for source voltage,
          resistor 1, and resistor 2, with outputs of current, voltage 1, and
          voltage 2 when "Calculate" is clicked.
        </p>
        <p class="multi">
          If the user selects the 'Remove the Track Bar' check box, there is now
          a new current calculation for the Amps passing through R2. The user
          now must provide a Power value, which has a default value of 1.5
          Watts. Once 'Calculate' is pressed, the Source Voltage, both currents,
          and each individual voltage value will be calculated and displayed.

        <p>
          This application allows the user to graph a 2nd-degree parabola based

          'y = ax^2 + bx + c', along with values for how much of the graph you'd
          like to see: xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, and how many points you want

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          This project involved us importing a Histo.dll file, which was made in
          Visual Basic. This Histo library contains a method, CreateHistogram,
          which creates a histogram of each alphabetical character in a word. We
          were also given two txt files, one for potential anagrams, and one
          with the confirmed anagrams.

          The design is simplistic, with a ListBox and a button. When the button

          In this application, we were given a txt and xml file containing
          information about blood tests of Hepatitis patients, which we had to

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          For this lab, I had to buy an Arduino kit, along with an infrared
          distance sensor. I wired the distance sensor to the Arduino chip,
          where the data will be sent through the Serial Port.
        </p>
        <p class="multi">
          I then wrote a MATLAB script to receive the data instead of the Server
          Monitor. With the distance data, I calculated the velocity and
          acceleration of the object as it moved, and plotted it on subplots
          with the distance.
        </p>
        <p class="multi">
          Finally, I derived a first order fit of the distance data to depict
          the trend of the data and created a best-fit polynomial of the data.
