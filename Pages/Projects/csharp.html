        This is the in depth page for all of my C# projects! These all came from
        my EGR 1400 - Computer Problem Solving course, where the first nine are
        labs that I completed and the last is part of a Problem Solving
        assignment. All of these projects were made myself using Visual Studio
        2022 and the .NET Windows Forms App Template.

          100 and 30 and 100, one to calculate the mean and standard deviation
          of those scores, one to clear all of the data, and one to exit the
          application.

          >
          that was given to us. There are four different calculation criteria,
          based on the gender of the participant and whether they are above or
          below 30 years old. For example, if 'Male' is selected, the user must
          input their waist, hips, forearm, and wrist measurements. Conversely,
          if 'Female' is selected, the user must input their hips, thigh, calf,
          and wrist measurements.

          At the end, the user clicks 'Calculate', which will display how many
          pounds of lean body weight and fat the user has, along with the

          This project involved us re-creating the popular card game
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps">Craps</a>. For this, we
          were given the basic rules, along with a flowchart and a background

          Point, which is displayed using pucks at the top. Each time the die
          are rolled, two random numbers are generated, along with their
          corresponding dice images. Depending on the roll and situation
          (initial roll or second and onwards), the user's score and Point will
          be updated.

          This application allows the user to work with either a two or three

          track bar or not, which is used to adjust the Source Voltage. If the
          user clicks to remove the track bar, the Source Voltage is now what's
          being calculated, and an input for power appears.

        <p>
          This project involved us importing a Histo.dll file, which was made in
          Visual Basic. This Histo library contains a method, CreateHistogram,
          which creates a histogram, in the form of an array, of each
          alphabetical character in a word. We were also given two txt files,
          one for potential anagrams, and one with the confirmed anagrams.

          The design is simplistic, with a ListBox and a button. When the button
          is pressed, all of the found anagrams, along with what word/phrase
          they came from, are displayed.

          In this application, we were given a txt and xml file containing

          The UI consists only of a single "Analyze" button. When pressed, the

          For this lab, I had to buy an Arduino kit along with an infrared

          where the data will be sent through the Serial Port.

          I then wrote a MATLAB script to receive the data instead of the Server

          acceleration and plotted them all on subplots.

        <p class="multi">
          Finally, I derived a first order fit of the distance data to depict
          the trend of the data and created a best-fit polynomial of the data.

        <p>
          For this project we were given 8 pairs of x and y values. With these,
          we had to find a0, a1, and a2 for a parabolic least squares regression
          using Microsoft Excel. Instead of manually typing in and doing the
          calculations within Excel, we wrote Visual Basic code to automate the
          process.
        </p>
        <p class="multi">
          The UI is very basic, with a large button that, when pressed, will
          start the process. Within the Excel file, it writes down the two
          matrices we manually entered, the values of them multiplied together,
          and then the inverse of that result. This will end up solving for the
          coefficients for parabolic least squares regression (of degree 2). The
          generated Microsoft Excel file will also be saved in a specific folder
          within the user's system.
