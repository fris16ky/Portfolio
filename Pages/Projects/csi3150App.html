      <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
      <p>This project was a part of the latter half of my Web and Mobile Systems class. Similarly, we were given open reign, with the goal to build a dynamic app that can be run on Android systems. </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>To create this project, I used React Native and Expo to send it to mobile apps (finish later; brain is mush + Prettier isn't functional).</p>
      <p>Building off of my web application, I wanted to maintain a similar theme. I ended up settling with a simplistic to-do list project. However, there is beauty within simplicity; anyone can pick up this app and instantly understand how to use it. </p>
      <br />
      <p><h2>Description: </h2>This mobile application was made during the latter half 
        of my CSI 3150 Web and Mobile Systems course. I used both React Native and Expo 
        to get this running, although I did not work on functionality for Apple devices.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this app was simplistic; akin to the 
      <a href="./csi3150Website.html">Calendar Website</a>, I simply wanted an efficient way to
      keep track of any reminders that I wanted to set throughout the course of a day or week.
