      <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        We were tasked with creating a group of 3-4 people, where our task is to
        provide a service, while hosting our project on a Google Cloud Platform
        Virtual Machine. In addition to the service, we had to write at least
        one automated script, periodically log system features, write a script
        to backup our server, and create a webpage.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        Our classwork was done in CentOS7, but we switched to Ubuntu for the
        duration of the project. As was a popular decision, our group decided on
        provided a multiplayer game server for a subgame within Garry's Mod;
        Trouble in Terrorist Town. Running this project does cost money, so the
        server is only functional when choose to run our VM.

      In this class, our final exam/project was to run an accessible game server
      using the Google Cloud Platform. When the class started, our professor
      gave us credits that could last us until the end of the year, if not
      longer. It was our job to use our Linux knowledge and what we've learned
      about system administration to create a sustainable game server.
    </p>
    <p>
      My group ending up choosing to make a server for a Steam game called
      Garry's Mod. Steam is a digital library where people from around the world
      can all search for and download, create mods, and have a community for a
      wide variety of video games.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we used CentOS 7 during our class, we decided to switch to Ubuntu
      for the creation of our server
    </p>
    <li style="text-align: center">
      Show and link the website we make for our game, and show a video (maybe
      our submitted demo?) of us running through our server to prove it works
      and such
