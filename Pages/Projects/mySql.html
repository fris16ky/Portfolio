    <h1>MySQL Database Project</h1>
    <p>
      My partner and I designed a database that would hold information about
      colleges; Universities, Employees, Head of Departments; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      In total, we created 10 entities, with a total of 51 attributes, albeit
      not all unique. On page 6 of our report, we created an Excel spreadsheet
      that outlined the important pieces of data for each Entity, along with an
      Entity Relationship Model the following page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Page 9 started the code that we inputted to MySQL, creating a table for
      every entity. After the initial creation, we inserted 3-5 data points for
      each table. After the Database was ready, we created 5 queries to return
      different amounts and types of data from our database.
    </p>

      I really don't need both of these. The Presentation is much cleaner, so I
      should probably just keep that - I'll need to adjust my above writing tho
      (i.e. what page). But Presentation >
