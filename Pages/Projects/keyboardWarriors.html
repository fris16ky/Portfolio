      <p class="text">Keyboard Warriors was a group project made in CSI 2999 - Sophomore Project. 
      Our vision for the project was to create a game that can improve the user's 
      ability to type efficiently on their phone.
      </p>
      <p class="text">Growing up, we played numerous games to help improve our typing
      on a computer, but never anything for mobile devices. We decided to act on this 
      niche in the market by putting out our product; Keyboard Warriors.
      </p>
      <p class="text">Under the monicre "Five Man Games", we developed an Android Studio project that 
      contained a tutorial and three levels; Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty. 
      </p>
      <p class="text">Within each level users would defeat enemies by 
      correctly typing in the prompted words. If the user types and submits an incorrect word,
      they will lose a heart. Similarly, a heart will be lost if the user does 
      not submit any word within the given time limit. Once the user loses three hearts, the 
      game is over.
      </p>
      <p class="text">After defeating 20 (I think) enemies, a Boss Fight occurs. Bosses
      has more health than the regular enemies, taking ~7 correct words to defeat it (unsure about #). 
      </p>
      <p class="text">https://www.piskelapp.com/ I think we used this for our sprites/animations. Unsure tho</p>
