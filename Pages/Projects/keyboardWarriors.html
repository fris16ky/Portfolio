      <h2>Project Demo: </h2>
      <p>Demo goes here!</p>
      <br />
      <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
      <p>Our general task was to find a group and to separate into three roles; Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the Development Team. I was apart of the Development Team along with two others, meaning we were tasked with developing our application. Aside from that, we were allowed to explore any options for our app, but we had to keep track of our progress, which we did via GitHub and <a href="https://monday.com/">Monday</a>.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>I was directly involved with choosing our project idea, where I took inspiration from <a href="https://www.typetolearn.app/">Type to Learn</a>, which I played a lot during Elementary and Middle School. </p>
      <p>Akin to Type to Learn, we wanted to improve our user's ability to type efficiently. When I used Type to Learn, it was only for computers, so we shifted our vision to improve the ever-important phone-typing skills.</p>
      <br />
      <!-- <p class="text">Growing up, we played numerous games to help improve our typing
      on a computer, but never anything for mobile devices. We decided to act on this 
      niche in the market by putting out our product; Keyboard Warriors.
      </p>
      <p class="text">Under the moniker "Five Man Games", we developed an Android Studio project that 
      contained a tutorial and three levels; Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty. 
      </p>
      <p class="text">Within each level users would defeat enemies by 
      correctly typing in the prompted words. If the user types and submits an incorrect word,
      they will lose a heart. Similarly, a heart will be lost if the user does 
      not submit any word within the given time limit. Once the user loses three hearts, the 
      game is over.
      </p>
      <p class="text">After defeating 20 (I think) enemies, a Boss Fight occurs. Bosses
      has more health than the regular enemies, taking ~7 correct words to defeat it (unsure about #). 
      </p>
      <p class="text">https://www.piskelapp.com/ I think we used this for our sprites/animations. Unsure tho</p>
