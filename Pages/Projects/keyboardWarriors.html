      <h2>Project Demo:</h2>
      <p>Demo goes here!</p>
      <!-- For demo, mention that we named our group Five Man Games, which is the first logo you'll see -->
      <br />
      <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Our general task was to find a group and to separate into three roles;
        Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the Development Team. I was apart of
        the Development Team along with two others, meaning we were tasked with
        developing our application. Aside from that, we were allowed to explore
        any options for our app, but we had to keep track of our progress, which
        we did via GitHub and <a href="https://monday.com/">Monday</a>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <!-- This isn't really a description, more like reasoning behind why we did this project. This isn't
      describing how/what our project is, but that may be fine since I have the demo? -->
      <p>
        I was directly involved with choosing our project idea, where I took
        inspiration from
        <a href="https://www.typetolearn.app/">Type to Learn</a>, which I was
        introduced to during Elementary and Middle School.
      </p>
      <p>
        Akin to Type to Learn, we wanted to improve our user's ability to type
        efficiently, although the former was for computer keyboards. Thus, we
        shifted our vision to the crucial skill that is typing on your phone.
