    <p>Keyboard Warriors was a group project made for CSI 2999 - Sophomore Project. 
    Our vision for the project was to create a game that can improve the user's 
    ability to proficiently type on their phones.</p>
    <p>Growing up, we played numerous games that would aid in improving our typing
      on a computer, but never anything for mobile devices. We decided to act on this 
      niche in the market by putting out our product; Keyboard Warriors.
    </p>
    <p>Under the monicre "Five Man Games", we developed an Android Studio game that 
      contained four levels; a Tutorial, Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty. 
    </p>
    <p>Within each level, aside from the tutorial, users would defeat enemies by 
    correctly typing in the prompted words. If the user incorrectly types, and submits,
    a word, the user will lose a heart. Similarly, a heart will be lost if the user does 
    not submit any word within the time limit. Once the user loses three hearts, the 
    game is over.</p>
    <p>After defeating 20 (I think) enemies, 
    the user now enters a Boss Fight. The Boss has more health than the regular enemies, 
    where it takes 7 correct words in a row to defeat it (unsure about #). 
    </p>
    <p>https://www.piskelapp.com/ I think we used this for our sprites/animations. Unsure tho</p>
