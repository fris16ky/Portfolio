      My website/game server project from CSI 3660 - System Administration

      In this class, our final exam/project was to run an accessible game server
      using the Google Cloud Platform. When the class started, our professor
      gave us credits that could last us until the end of the year, if not
      longer. It was our job to use our Linux knowledge and what we've learned
      about system administration to create a sustainable game server.

      My group ending up choosing to make a server for a Steam game called
      Garry's Mod. Steam is a digital library where people from around the world
      can all search for and download, create mods, and have a community for a
      wide variety of video games.

      While we used CentOS 7 during our class, we decided to switch to Ubuntu
      for the creation of our server

    <li>
      Show and link the website we make for our game, and show a video (maybe
      our submitted demo?) of us running through our server to prove it works
      and such
