      Take heavy inspiration from erikwadkins for this. His is clean af. He did
      put his website into github, so that will be helpful for bouncing my ideas
      off of his

      I was going to make the navigation tags for this, but I'm 90% sure this
      page will be removed and just added to the bottom of the Index
    </p>
    ***Just as a note, all of these individual HTML pages (or, at least most of
    them) will all be combined in the index page. I'll probably have individual
    pages for my big projects, including the reports and maybe a demo? But
    skills, AboutMe, relatedCourses + will hopefully all be on one cohesive page

        Base text off of Eric's wording lightly. Nowhere near copying, but it's
        good for noting what is useful to talk about/mention.

            Java was the first language I learned; I have around 4 years of
            experience learning about and using the language. With Java, I have
            experience with Wireshark and creating an Android Studio
            Application.

          <!-- <p>
        I have close to 4 years of software development experience (maybe just
        call it experience, since I wasn't developing anything) with Java. I
        don't have anything to show for it though, no projects or anything. My
        journey with Java began with AP Computer Science in 2018-2019, and a few
        college courses built upon that knowledge, but I am not as familiar as I
        am with other languages.

            I began Python at the end of 2021, where my main experience came
            with designing and analyzing algorithms and dealing with runtime.

          <p>
            I have a few months of experience with HTML, with my class starting
            in September. I have created my own front-end, GitHub-ran website
            along with other various web applications including a calculator and
            a quiz app. I also trialed with Node.js and tailwind CSS.

        HTML, CSS, JavaScript - I am pretty fresh in terms of experience; I took
        my first class on it this year with CSI 3150. However, throughout my
        learning, I developed a frontend website (a modified Google Calendar),
        and with reactJS and reactNative I developed a mobile application akin
        to Uber, but with only Tesla vehicles.

            I have also only worked with React for a few months at the end of
            2022. My experience includes developing clones of AirBnB, and Uber,
            the latter of which we learned how to embed and use the Google API.
            I also developed my own mobile expo application, which was made for
            Android devices.

          <h4 style="margin-bottom: 4px; color: navy">Google Cloud Platform</h4>
          <p>
            I began using the Google Cloud Platform during my fall semester of
            2022. I first used it for System Administration, where we learned
            how to navigate Linux and the GCP, as well as working with
            scripting. Eventually, my group of 4 created a
            <a href="./Projects/sysAdminProject.html">multiplayer server</a> for
            the game Garry's Mod as our final project.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            I have a few years of experience working under C and Linux. For my
            System Administration class we worked with the Google Cloud Platform
            to write scripts and the like. For my group project in this class,
            we switched to Ubuntu when creating a Multiplayer Server for a game
            called Garry's Mod. Additionally, I joined Oakland University's SAE
            (Society of Automotive Engineers) team, where I developed running
            code for our 2023 racecar that performed at Events in *locations
            here?*.

            I have a few months of experience in MATLAB. I mainly learned this
            at the end of my course in C#, in coordination with an Arduino Uno.
            The Arduino received a feed from a sensor, which plotted points on a
            matlab plot based on how close an object was to the sensor.
            Additional plots were made for the first (velocity) and second
            (acceleration) derivatives of the position plot.

          Add whatever I did for my Senior Capstone Project here, if need be.
          Will *probably* fit under one of the other categories, and will also
          be late for the first round of applications.
