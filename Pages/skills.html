    ***Just as a note, all of these individual HTML pages (or, at least most of
    them) will all be combined in the index page. I'll probably have individual
    pages for my big projects, including the reports and maybe a demo? But
    skills, AboutMe, relatedCourses + will hopefully all be on one cohesive page
    <h1>Skills: (format later - go in order too; most exp to least)</h1>
    <li>
      Java - I have close to 4 years of software development experience (maybe
      just call it experience, since I wasn't developing anything) with Java. I
      don't have anything to show for it though, no projects or anything. My
      journey with Java began with AP Computer Science in 2018-2019, and a few
      college courses built upon that knowledge, but I am not as familiar as I
      am with other languages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Python - I have a little over a year of software development experience
      with Python. I was introduced and fell in love during my Design and
      Analysis of Algorithms class. Here is one personal project I have: (pls)
    </li>
    <li>
      HTML, CSS, JavaScript - I am pretty fresh in terms of experience; I took
      my first class on it this year with CSI 3150. However, throughout my
      learning, I developed a frontend website (a modified Google Calendar), and
      with reactJS and reactNative I developed a mobile application akin to
      Uber, but with only Tesla vehicles.
    </li>
    <li>
      C# - I have moderate experience with creating applications with C#. In my
      EGR 1400 class, we developed GUIs for card games, health detectors,
      parabola creators, etc. whilst using Visual Studio with .NET Framework.
    </li>
    <li>
      MySQL - I have moderate experience with navigating databases under MySQL.
      Under CSI 3450, I co-developed a database for *insert details here* -
      maybe show project report too.
    </li>
    <li>
      C - I have a few years of experience working under C and Linux. For my
      System Administration class we worked with the Google Cloud Platform to
      write scripts and the like. For my group project in this class, we
      switched to Ubuntu when creating a Multiplayer Server for a game called
      Garry's Mod. Additionally, I joined Oakland University's SAE (Society of
      Automotive Engineers) team, where I developed running code for our 2023
      racecar that performed at Events in *locations here?*.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add whatever I did for my Senior Capstone Project here, if need be. Will
      *probably* fit under one of the other categories, and will also be late
      for the first round of applications.
