        My website, formally known as Poodle Scheduler, was created for the
        midterm of my CSI 3150 - Web and Mobile Systems class. In this class, we
        were tasked with creating a website using the generic combination of
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was my first attempt at venturing into
        the world of web design!

        My inspiration directly came from Google Calendar. I have had a Google
        phone for over 6 years (Google Pixel 2 XL, then recently the Google
        Pixel 6), and have loved the feature of setting reminders and having
        those sync to the Google Calendar. I have used this feature everyday,
        and it has helped tremendously
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, I strove to create a similar product. With Poodle Scheduler, I
        wanted to bring back the Agendas that I used to use for Elementary and
        Middle School. In this sense, I allowed the user to create and delete
        reminders during the scope of the project; which happened to be until
        the end of 2022. *More info*

        To fit the name, I embarked on creating a Puppy Slideshow to showcase my
        other passion; photography and animals. I included simplistic and funny
        pictures of my dog, Mia, along with my friend and Grandparent's dog. In
        the midst, I also added a few photos I took myself of nature. This
        lightened the seriousness of the project, and was a lot of fun to make.
