    This will be where I am trying to implement style and such. I will also be
    putting crude ideas whilst taking inspiration from abroad
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      For our System Administration project, we chose to run a Multiplayer
      server for the game Garry's Mod. Garry's Mod is a sandbox (free to do
      whatever) game, which doubles as a host for a variety of other games; such
      as Prop Hunt and TTT.
    </p>
    <p>We chose to create a server for TTT; Trouble in Terrorist Town.</p>
    <!-- Image of our welcome screen -->
    <p>
      Above is what every player sees when loading into our server; our take on
      a Welcome Screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the game starts, all of the players are sorted between 3 roles:
      Detective, Terrorist, and Innocent. There is usually only one Detective,
      who's purpose is to weed out the suspicious players (Terrorists) that are
      trying to kill everyone else. The Terrorist's job is to eliminate the
      remaining players while also staying alive, with the Innocents trying
      their best to survive and determine who is guilty.
    </p>
    <h2>Maps</h2>
    <p>
      In order to play the game, we have our players load in one of our two
      maps.
    </p>
    <h3>Map 1: Minecraft Haven</h3>
    <!-- Image from the map, maybe a description -->
    <h3>Map 2: Dust2</h3>
    <!-- Images -->
    <p>
      This map comes from the popular Tactical Shooter, Counter-Strike: Global
      Offensive. However, the map we implemented was a very early build, so the
      graphics aren't the most appealing
