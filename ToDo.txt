List of upcoming goals I want to meet for this Portfolio: 
Finish the Investo page
Start and Finish the Keylogger page
Update/Add more skills - from classes and such. Things like C/Embedded Programming?
Update the skills text. Make them more specific and add any new changes
Update with my final GPA and everything. Should be done around 5/5?
Start trying for Certifications and shit to spice up my resume/portfolio. Maybe ask GPT for suggestions and search for free alternatives. 

In case I don't find a job soon: 
Certifications
Take Classes/Lessons in Algorithms (learn a lot more, be able to code them at will)
Practice/Learn From LeetCode for general knowledge gainers
Make Cover Letters for applications detailing what I can specifically bring to the company from their qualifications
WORK ON MORE PROJECTS - Having a personal Python Project would be great. 


I think I want to try to do a Python one for parsing a One Piece website to see how much I've spent watching it
Seems like I'll have to use MyAnimeList. The movies have a duration, One Piece the series does as well. 
https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Fris16ky
Just have to click on each thing that says One Piece and take the values after it says "duration". Then if the title says "ep x" and x is > 1, times that 
duration by whatever the value for it is. 
Let's have it print the names of each movie we've watched too. Also how many eps of One Piece in general. Only have to worry about 1+ episodes since there
isn't and won't be anything with more than 1 episode aside from the actual anime.

So, for web scraping we give the URL and essentially inspect the page's XML/HTML file. So, for each individual movie/show, we can just search for information
on that hyperlink? Big hopeage. When I'm writing this, log everything first. Like when I think it's functional, make it log the hyperlink for each show. Then
make it log the duration THEN worry about adding em and multiplying n shit

for this, the links we want are in <a href="/anime/21/One_Piece">
example for movie (First Movie - One Piece Movie 01): <td class="data title clearfix"> <a href="/anime/459/One_Piece_Movie_01" .../>
So, maybe see if it's possible to search for anchor tags with /anime/*/One_Piece*

Consider adding a 'Technology' portion to each project. It'd be nice to have everything out in front. i.e. back-end, front-end (language), IDE, any other tools. 
This sounds like a 500/10 idea ngl
Update skills with new info and projects done (new classes too)
Need to update everything related to Responsive Design, I'm sure all of my new additions make it ugly
Update the Unity pic too; want a base picture of the platformer rn than a Unity logo; will fix the hover brightness issue too
