          is REALLY nice, and keeps his portfolio very precise. It's all one on
          page, with the Navigation tools dragging you down to each section.
          i.e. Projects, Skills, About Me, etc. I'd have to learn the style by
          hand, but it seems to be the most inviting of the few ones I've looked
          at so far. It's a shit ton of code, but I did find his GitHub page for
          it. Definitely DEFINITELY look into and try to copy/adapt his vision.

          this page, I appreciate the "Major-related Coursework" page, I think
          that'll help me a lot. Her design choices are very simplistic, and I
          appreciate that. It's more realistic than the Eric Wadkins one, so
          I'll merge the two I imagine. First problem is functionality, then we
          move to making it look pretty! She does not have her code uploaded on
          GitHub however. A little more tricky

          I am currently a senior at

          Hills, Michigan. I am <br />studying Computer Science, with a
          specialization in System Administration. <br /><br />
          I grew up in Springboro, Ohio, but moved to Michigan in 2010, where
          I've lived ever sense. <br />I have been playing video games and using
          computers since I was very young, and I fell in love <br />with coding
          in my AP Computer Science course in my Junior year at high school.
          <br /><br />
          My interests include software development, database management,
          statistics, and working with webpages.
