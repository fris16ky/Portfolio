    So this will be my portfolio for school/resume building. Currently, this is
    what I should add:
    <p>
      NEW IDEA: So, pulling from both examples. In the long, scroll-down home
      page, we'll have mini descriptions of each project. If they want, there'll
      be a "Learn More" or something, to take you to the full blown HTML page.
      On that page, there'll be a demo running you through the highlights
      (unlisted YouTube link? - need a fresh account for that though)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ***MAIN*** one website that I saw,
        <a href="http://www.ericwadkins.com/" target="blank"
          >http://www.ericwadkins.com/</a
        >
        is REALLY nice, and keeps his portfolio very precise. It's all one on
        page, with the Navigation tools dragging you down to each section. i.e.
        Projects, Skills, About Me, etc. I'd have to learn the style by hand,
        but it seems to be the most inviting of the few ones I've looked at so
        far. It's a shit ton of code, but I did find his GitHub page for it.
        Definitely DEFINITELY look into and try to copy/adapt his vision.
      </li>
      <li>
        Going off of this, for the Projects portion, I do want the little
        pictures, but instead of it bringing you to a pop-up, I think I'd rather
        have that lead to separate pages, where I can dedicate more effort into
        them (since I have few projects)
      </li>
      <li>
        From http://www.meganlandau.com/portfolio-1 this page, I appreciate the
        "Major-related Coursework" page, I think that'll help me a lot. Her
        design choices are very simplistic, and I appreciate that. It's more
        realistic than the Eric Wadkins one, so I'll merge the two I imagine.
        First problem is functionality, then we move to making it look pretty!
        She does not have her code uploaded on GitHub however. A little more
        tricky
      </li>

      <li>
        GitHub Page (which will have a majority of my repositories, but it's
        better to have an interactive webpage Showing them/linking to them as
        opposed to them having to click it then click thru the different repos.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keyboard Warriors (Android Studio Game); probably can't embed, but link
        Project Reports and such
      </li>
      <li>
        My CSI 3150 Project Part 1 Website (include an anchor tag to get them to
        my github-hosted link
      </li>
      <li>Maybe a couple of demos that we do/did in CSI 3150?</li>
      <li>
        Try to showcase other languages - maybe figure out a way to show my C#
        coding?
      </li>
      <li>
        Have an About Me Page - list all of the Languages I've learned, and what
        classes I took with them -- showcase some code with it. i.e. Craps game
        for C#, Database project for Microsoft SQL, Keyboard Warriors in Java.
      </li>
      <li>My Mobile App for 3150 Project Part 2</li>
      <li>
        3660 Project - creating a website and running a Game Server (Garry's
        Mod) using Google Cloud (GCP) and Linux
      </li>
      <li>
        Information/Code from my Arduino work (in SAE? but mainly C# - EGR 1400)
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't forget to Git Init and upload this to my GitHub page as well. Have
        this portfolio page in the main part of my resume, which I also need to
        revamp
      </li>
      <li>
        Maybe include info from high school? Marching Band for 4 years, Band for
        7 years, Jazz Band 2 years, Science NHS, Co-Founder of the Stoney Creek
        High School Mountain Biking Team, AP classes (Comp Sci, Calc BC,
        Statistics, Lang, Micro Economics - or maybe just the ones I got College
        Credit for - Principle of Microeconomics, Calculus 1, Calculus 2, Intro
        Stat Concepts/Reasoning)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="ProjectsContainer">
      <br />
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <!-- Maybe make the font of Projects cool, and prolly a little bigger, maybe dif color too -->
      <p>
        This will be where all my of project information is held. We need images
        for each one, which when hovered will gray out a little.
      </p>
      <p>
        ***For Keyboard Warriors, I'll need to take the screenshot from my
        Desktop since I don't want to bother with importing from GitHub to my
        laptop.

      <a href="./Pages/Projects/csi3150Website.html">
        <img

        *Wrap this to the right of the image. This project is my Website, made
        for CSI 3150 Web and Mobile Systems. Click on the image to navigate to
        the Project Page. ***Probably do text-align left for this one boss.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, just putting these up here. Not doing anything special. Also,
        when hovering over the images, darken. Also change the background colors
        or something for each section? (About Me, Projects, etc.). Will need to
        fix the cropping for the pics tho, or keep this part white for sanity.
        Unsure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the image takes up too much space. Maybe just have an icon here
        instead? Like my favicon for the webpage, that can be small-ish. Right
        now, it's kinda daunting with lots of un-used space since I'm not going
        to write an essay description for each Project.
