          is REALLY nice, and keeps his portfolio very precise. It's all one on
          page, with the Navigation tools dragging you down to each section.
          i.e. Projects, Skills, About Me, etc. I'd have to learn the style by
          hand, but it seems to be the most inviting of the few ones I've looked
          at so far. It's a shit ton of code, but I did find his GitHub page for
          it. Definitely DEFINITELY look into and try to copy/adapt his vision.

          this page, I appreciate the "Major-related Coursework" page, I think
          that'll help me a lot. Her design choices are very simplistic, and I
          appreciate that. It's more realistic than the Eric Wadkins one, so
          I'll merge the two I imagine. First problem is functionality, then we
          move to making it look pretty! She does not have her code uploaded on
          GitHub however. A little more tricky

          <br />
          I am currently a senior at
          <a href="https://www.oakland.edu/">Oakland University</a> in Auburn
          Hills, Michigan. I am <br />studying Computer Science, with a
          specialization in System Administration. <br /><br />
          I grew up in Springboro, Ohio, but moved to Michigan in 2010, where
          I've lived ever sense. <br />I have been playing video games and using
          computers since I was very young, and I fell in love <br />with coding
          in my AP Computer Science course in my Junior year at high school.
          <br /><br />
          My interests include software development, database management,
          statistics, and working with webpages.

        For now, just putting these up here. Not doing anything special. Also,
        when hovering over the images, darken. Also change the background colors
        or something for each section? (About Me, Projects, etc.). Will need to
        fix the cropping for the pics tho, or keep this part white for sanity.
        Unsure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the image takes up too much space. Maybe just have an icon here
        instead? Like my favicon for the webpage, that can be small-ish. Right
        now, it's kinda daunting with lots of un-used space since I'm not going
        to write an essay description for each Project.
