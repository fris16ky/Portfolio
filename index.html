          I am currently a senior at
          <a href="https://www.oakland.edu/">Oakland University</a> in Auburn
          Hills, Michigan. I am <br />studying Computer Science, with a
          specialization in System Administration. <br /><br />
          I grew up in Springboro, Ohio, but moved to Michigan in 2010, where
          I've lived ever sense. <br />I have been playing video games and using
          computers since I was very young, and I fell in love with coding in my
          AP Computer Science course in my Junior year at high school.
          <br /><br />
          My interests include software development, database management,
          statistics, and working with webpages.

            I have limited experience with Ruby; I took an intro class on it in
            the Fall Semester of 2022. This class was asynchronous where we read
            out of the textbook, but there were a few interesting projects that
            worked on out of the book, but nothing too complex.
